const chatbotResponse = "* Okay, so I saw a picture of the periodic table, and it looks like the element names are labeled in a bunch of bright, fun colors \u2013  lots of pinks, oranges, yellows, greens, blues, and even some purples!  That's a cool image!\n\n* I found a few items that might vibe with the colorful theme, though they aren't directly related to the periodic table itself.  I saw some gold earrings, a blue bag, and even a sweet-smelling perfume.\n\n* For complementary items, I thought you might like this \"[productDisplayName]\" (not sure what that is exactly, but it sounds interesting!), a T-shirt, a light brown handbag, a multicolored bag (to match all those element colors!), and a silver watch.\n\n* Is this kind of what you were thinking of? Let me know!  I'm happy to keep looking if these aren't quite right. \ud83d\ude0a\n";
