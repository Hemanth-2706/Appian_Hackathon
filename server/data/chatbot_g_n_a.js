I found some similar Nike T90 shirts, including a few different color variations in white and blue.\n\nTo go with those, I thought some accessories would be cool. I pulled up some sunglasses, a pair of white shoes (Nike Air Dictates!), some jeans, and a brown belt.  A cap could also work, I found a blue Adidas one and another slim, shady style.\n\nIs that kind of what you were looking for? Let me know!\n";
